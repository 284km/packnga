h1. Tutorial

We introduce how to use Packnga with Packnga's Rakefile in this page.

h2. Install

You can install Packnga from Rubygems.

<pre>
!!!command_line
% sudo gem install packnga
</pre>

h2. Prepare to create tasks

Before using Packnga, you should create @spec@ variable with Jeweler::Task.new.
Packnga create tasks with @spec@.
Please see below example.

<pre>
spec = nil
Jeweler::Tasks.new do |_spec|
  spec = _spec
  spec.name = "packnga"
  spec.version = version
  spec.rubyforge_project = "groonga"
  spec.homepage = "http://groonga.rubyforge.org/"
  spec.authors = ["Haruka Yoshihara", "Kouhei Sutou"]
  spec.email = ["yoshihara@clear-code.com", "kou@clear-code.com"]
  entries = File.read("README.textile").split(/^h2\.\s(.*)$/)
  description = cleanup_white_space(entries[entries.index("Description") + 1])
  spec.summary, spec.description, = description.split(/\n\n+/, 3)
  spec.license = "LGPLv2"
  spec.files = FileList["lib/**/*.rb",
                        "Rakefile",
                        "README.textile",
                        "Gemfile",
                        "doc/text/**"]
  spec.test_files = FileList["test/**/*.rb"]
end
</pre>

If you set the attribute @rubyforge_project@ of @spec@,
@Release Task@ create tasks for rubyforge.
